- the header element cannot be placed inside the main element as it can disturb the semantic nature for visual apps
- <textarea>
- to remove the resize cursor from textares we use resize:none property in textarea selector

- WORD WRAP
- {
  word-wrap: break-word;
  }
- it is used to make the word to continue in next line
- but it worked only for <p> tag,(li,span... it did not worked)
- we also need to enter the width for it to work

- REVISE
- HTML structure (where should header,main,article,aside... be placed)

- DOUBT
- Im unable to add <hr/> tag dynamically in the mapped array - cusz i had made mistake in syntax </hr> instead of <hr>
- i was adding the "/" before only
